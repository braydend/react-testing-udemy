Using Create-React-App to generate a new React project that I can develop and test.

Create React App's `npm test` script runs Jest in watch mode. Watch mode only tests files changed since the last commit!

Enzyme is a tool that can create a virtual DOM. You can search the DOM with jQuery-style selectors, you can also fire synthetic events and access Component's props and state.
